# ArkTracer

ArkTracer is a debugging and validation tool for Ladder Logic and Plutus file types. It aims to bridge the gap between traditional automation engineering and blockchain development by providing a reliable environment for testing and validating smart contracts on Cardano. The project is in its early stages, focusing on building core functionalities and achieving seamless integration within the Morley ecosystem.

## Overview

ArkTracer is designed to:
- Debug and validate Ladder Logic and Plutus scripts.
- Provide meaningful insights into contract execution and state changes.
- Support developers and automation engineers in identifying and resolving issues.

Currently, ArkTracer is in the early phases of development. It performs basic debugging tasks and offers initial validation checks. While functional, the tool is still being refined to ensure robustness, accuracy, and usability.

## Current Status

ArkTracer is a work in progress. At present, it:
- Parses and validates Ladder Logic and Plutus scripts.
- Offers basic debugging tools for identifying errors and inconsistencies.
- Supports initial contract state visualization.

However, the tool has limitations:
- The user interface is functional but lacks advanced visualization features.
- Debugging capabilities are basic and need further development.
- Support for complex contract scenarios is limited.

## Roadmap

ArkTracer aims to be the go-to debugging and validation tool for Ladder Logic-based smart contracts on Cardano. Future plans include:
- Enhancing debugging tools with more detailed error reporting.
- Improving contract state visualization and user interface design.
- Expanding support for complex contract scenarios.
- Integrating with other Morley tools for seamless workflows.
- Adding automated testing and simulation features for robust contract validation.
