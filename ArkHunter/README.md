# ArkHunter

ArkHunter is a tool for analyzing Cardano network parameter changes, helping developers and stakeholders stay informed about the evolving ecosystem. The project is in its early stages, with a focus on building a reliable and user-friendly solution that keeps pace with the dynamic nature of Cardano's on-chain governance and protocol updates.

## Overview

ArkHunter is designed to:
- Monitor changes in Cardano network parameters.
- Provide historical data and insights into parameter evolution.
- Help users understand the impact of these changes on the ecosystem.

Currently, ArkHunter is in the early stages of development. It captures basic parameter changes and presents them in a straightforward format. While functional, the tool lacks advanced features and a polished user experience. 

## Current Status

ArkHunter is a work in progress. At present, it:
- Tracks key network parameters and logs changes over time.
- Provides a basic interface for viewing parameter histories.
- Offers insights into the frequency and magnitude of changes.

However, the tool has limitations:
- The user interface is minimal, focusing more on functionality than design.
- It currently supports only a limited set of network parameters.
- Advanced analytics and visualization features are not yet implemented.

## Roadmap

ArkHunter aims to become a comprehensive network parameter analysis tool for Cardano. Future plans include:
- Enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive experience.
- Expanding support for additional network parameters.
- Adding advanced data visualization and analytics tools.
- Implementing notification systems for real-time parameter changes.
- Integrating with other Cardano tools and dashboards.
