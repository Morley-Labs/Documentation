# Morley Hybrid Time Logic

---

## Overview

**Morley Hybrid Time Logic** is a unique time enforcement mechanism designed to support both **real-time execution** and **slot-based enforcement** for smart contracts on the **Cardano blockchain**. This dual-layered approach enables **high-speed off-chain processing** while ensuring **on-chain finality** for deterministic state transitions. It provides a flexible and robust solution for **industrial automation systems**, allowing them to operate with real-time responsiveness and blockchain-level security.

### Vision and Intent
The primary purpose of Morley Hybrid Time Logic is to:
- Enable **real-time execution** for high-speed industrial automation systems using Hydra/Midgard/Sidechains
- Ensure **deterministic state transitions** and **finality** on Cardano Layer 1 (L1) using slot-based constraints
- Provide a **trustless time enforcement mechanism** that guarantees on-chain integrity while supporting off-chain flexibility
- Support **bi-directional compatibility** with the Morley Compiler and Reverse Compiler for seamless integration
- Enable hybrid automation use cases such as **programmable supply chains**, **real-time logistics**, and **industrial safety systems**

This dual-layered approach ensures that critical automation systems can **respond in real-time** while maintaining **trustless validation and finality** on the blockchain.

## Architecture

Morley Hybrid Time Logic operates on two layers:

### 1. Execution-Based Time Logic (Layer 2 - Hydra/Midgard)
- **Purpose:** Enables **high-speed off-chain execution** with minimal latency.
- **Environment:** Runs on **Hydra, Midgard, or other sidechains** designed for low-latency, high-throughput interactions.
- **Timestamping:** Records execution timestamps in a Plutus datum using the following structure:
```json
{
    "format": "verifiable" | "basic" | "structured",
    "timestamp": 1700000000,
    "machine_id": "MORLEY-PLC-001",
    "process_id": "LADDER-SEQ-12",
    "hash": "d5f1a8b0e...7c3e1"
}
```
- **On-Chain Finality:** Timestamps are not final until **anchored to Layer 1**.
- **Use Cases:** Ideal for **machine automation**, **SCADA systems**, and **real-time control loops** where instant transactions are required.
- **Design Philosophy:** Emphasizes **low-latency execution** while maintaining compatibility with on-chain validation.

### 2. Slot-Based Time Logic (Layer 1 - Cardano)
- **Purpose:** Ensures **deterministic state transitions** and **on-chain finality**.
- **Environment:** Runs on **Cardano Layer 1**, leveraging slot-based constraints.
- **Time Enforcement:** Uses `mustValidateIn` to enforce slot ranges for state transitions.
- **Finality and Verification:** Anchors timestamps on-chain for trustless validation and deterministic finality.
- **Use Cases:** Critical state changes, financial settlements, regulatory compliance, and industrial safety systems.
- **Design Philosophy:** Prioritizes **trustlessness and finality** for state transitions requiring high integrity and auditability.

## Hybrid Time Flow

### Layer 2 to Layer 1 Flow
1. **Real-Time Execution (Layer 2):** Timestamps are generated and stored in a Plutus datum off-chain.
2. **Event Trigger:** A trigger event (e.g., quality check, delivery confirmation) signals the need for on-chain finality.
3. **Anchoring on Layer 1:** The timestamp is committed to Cardano L1 for **deterministic validation**.
4. **Slot Constraints:** On L1, the timestamp is checked against slot constraints using `mustValidateIn`.
5. **Finality Confirmation:** Once validated, the state change is considered **final and trustless**.

### Anchoring Mechanism (Connecting Off-Chain to L1)
- **Option 1: On-Chain Anchoring (Plutus Transaction)**
  - A Plutus transaction includes:
    - L2 Timestamp stored in a Plutus datum.
    - Verification logic to ensure slot constraints are met.
    - A reference input proving the execution context.
  - **Use Case:** Full decentralization and automated smart contract enforcement.

- **Option 2: Off-Chain Anchoring (External Service)**
  - An off-chain service monitors L2 timestamps and submits them to L1 as needed.
  - Can batch multiple timestamps into a single transaction.
  - **Use Case:** Cost efficiency and low-latency execution.

## Verifiable Hash Anchoring

### Overview
**Verifiable Hash Anchoring** uses Blake2b hashing to ensure data integrity and tamper resistance by:
- Hashing the timestamp and storing the hash on-chain.
- Anchoring the timestamp with `mustValidateIn` using the hashed value.
- Allowing **reverse compilation** to restore Ladder Logic with the verified timestamp.

### Example Transformation
**Plutus Input:**
```haskell
mustValidateIn (from slot 1700000000)
-- Verifiable Hash: cc5f0d2ea144196379c332b7ce6553b26e6eef381fb3d1e9095533b49a915a4d
```
**Reverse Compiled into Ladder Logic:**
```plaintext
TON TimerX, 1700000000ms
// Verifiable Hash: cc5f0d2ea144196379c332b7ce6553b26e6eef381fb3d1e9095533b49a915a4d
```
- **Purpose:** Ensures the timestamp's integrity and provides a **trustless audit trail**.
