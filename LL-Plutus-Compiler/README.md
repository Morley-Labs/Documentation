---

## Overview

The **Ladder Logic to Plutus Compiler (PlutusLadder Compiler - PLC)** is a revolutionary tool that transforms traditional Ladder Logic programs into **Plutus smart contracts** on the **Cardano blockchain**. This compiler bridges the gap between **industrial automation** and **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, enabling deterministic and verifiable execution of automation logic on a trustless and transparent platform.

### Vision and Intent
The primary goal of the PlutusLadder Compiler is to bring the **industrial automation domain** into the realm of **blockchain technology**, allowing programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to interact with decentralized systems. It is designed to:
- Enable on-chain enforcement of industrial control logic
- Support both **real-time execution** (Hydra/Midgard/Sidechains) and **slot-based enforcement** (Cardano L1)
- Ensure deterministic and verifiable execution of automation sequences
- Provide a pathway for industrial automation systems to leverage **decentralized governance**, **token incentives**, and **supply chain automation**

This transformative approach opens up new possibilities for **Industry 4.0**, enabling **programmable supply chains**, **dynamic pricing models**, **on-chain quality control**, and **reputation scoring** for suppliers.

## Architecture

The compilation process is divided into three key stages:

### 1. Ladder Logic Parsing (LL-Parser)
- **Purpose:** Converts raw Ladder Logic into an **Intermediate Representation (IR)** called **LadderCore IR**.
- **Compatibility:** Supports **OpenPLC components**, including timers, counters, function blocks, arithmetic operations, and logical conditions.
- **Design Philosophy:** Emphasizes full feature parity with industry-standard PLCs while maintaining flexibility for on-chain execution.
- **Output:** Produces a structured IR JSON format that retains the original Ladder Logic's logic flow.

### 2. Validator-Based IR Transformation
- **Purpose:** Ensures the IR maintains **structural integrity** and **logical consistency** before proceeding to compilation.
- **Validation Checks:** Verifies the presence of essential Ladder Logic constructs such as timers, counters, arithmetic operations, and control flow.
- **Design Philosophy:** Enforces strict validation rules to prevent compilation errors and maintain logical correctness.

### 3. PlutusLadder Compiler
- **Purpose:** Transforms **LadderCore IR** into a structured **Plutus Haskell script**.
- **Implementation:** Uses `traceIfFalse` for validation logic to enforce conditions, timers, counters, and state transitions.
- **Output:** Produces **Plutus Core (PLC)** scripts for execution on the Cardano blockchain.
- **Real-Time and Slot-Based Execution:** Supports:
  - **Real-Time Execution:** Via Hydra/Midgard for high-speed, off-chain processing
  - **Slot-Based Enforcement:** Using Cardano L1 for on-chain finality and deterministic state changes

## Core Components

### 1. LL-Parser (`ll_parser.py`)
- Parses Ladder Logic code into **LadderCore IR**.
- Captures logical operations (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`), timers (`TON`, `TOF`), counters (`CTU`, `CTD`), arithmetic operations, comparators, and jump instructions.
- Outputs structured IR JSON format.

### 2. Validator IR Transform (`validator_ir_transform.py`)
- Ensures IR structural correctness before compilation.
- Verifies required elements (e.g., timers, counters, instructions) are present.
- Prevents compilation errors due to missing components.

### 3. PlutusLadder Compiler (`plutusladder_compiler.py`)
- Converts **LadderCore IR** into **Plutus Haskell** and **Plutus Core (PLC)**.
- Implements logical constraints using `traceIfFalse`.
- Supports conversion of Ladder Logic timers into Plutus validation constraints.
- Generates structured Plutus scripts for execution.

## Timeline and Development Progress

### Initial Vision
The project was conceived as a bridge between **traditional industrial automation** and **blockchain-based smart contracts**. The goal was to create a seamless integration layer that allows industrial automation engineers to write control logic in Ladder Logic while leveraging the **security, transparency, and trustlessness of Cardano smart contracts**.

### Development Milestones
1. **Concept and Architecture Design:** Completed in early 2024, defining the three-stage compilation process.
2. **LL-Parser:** Achieved full compatibility with OpenPLC components, including advanced logical operations and timers.
3. **Validator IR Transform:** Completed structural validation rules, ensuring IR consistency and logical integrity.
4. **PlutusLadder Compiler:** Successfully converting Ladder Logic into functional Plutus scripts with:
    - Full support for logical constraints and arithmetic operations
    - Timer conversion to Plutus validation constraints

### Challenges and Learning Curve
- **Complexity of Plutus Scripts:** Implementing nested conditions and state machines required extensive validation logic.
- **Real-Time Execution vs. On-Chain Finality:** Balancing high-speed execution on Hydra/Midgard with deterministic state changes on Cardano L1.
- **Ladder Logic to Plutus Mapping:** Achieving feature parity with traditional PLCs while preserving on-chain verifiability.

### Current Progress and Roadblocks
- **LL-Parser and Validator IR Transform:** Completed and fully functional.
- **PlutusLadder Compiler:** Functional but requires optimization for complex state machines and nested logic.
- **Optimization Challenges:** Reducing script size and gas fees while maintaining logical correctness.
